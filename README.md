Simply spawn rectangles and watch the lines they draw as they bounce around the screen! Make patterns, shapes, watch them bounce into corners. The perfect satisfaction fidget toy for when you're bored and for creating beautiful patterns.

Press s to spawn another rectangles, c to clear all the rectangles, and p to pause. To reset everything simply refresh the webpage.

btw don't skip stuff when entering parameters as otherwise you'll enter what's basically a null entity, which I'm assuming u guys probably don't want to do :)
